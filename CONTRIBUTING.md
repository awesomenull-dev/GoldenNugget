## 1. AI Usage & Testing Policy

While AI is a great development tool, **you must thoroughly test all code on your own device** before creating a pull request. 

* **Mandatory Testing:** Any untested or unstable code will be **automatically rejected**.
* **Proof of Working Code:** You must include screenshots or a video demonstrating that your code works correctly. PRs submitted without visual or technical evidence will be auto-rejected.

---

## 2. Bug Fixes

When submitting bug fixes (`[FIX]`), please ensure that:
* Your fix does **not** introduce new bugs.
* While GoldenNugget has historically had some long-term stability challenges, maintaining a reasonable baseline of normal stability is a top priority.

---

## 3. New Features & Tweaks

### Quality of Life (QOL) / App Features
* Features should **not** be redundant or useless. 
* GoldenNugget is already a large project; we want to avoid turning it into an overloaded "super-app" or bloatware ("elephant").
* Backports (e.g Cache function from 9.0 to 8.x) is NOT ALLOWED.

### Customization Tweaks
We welcome the following types of tweaks:
1. Porting old tweaks to newer iOS versions.
2. New plist-based tweaks (e.g., EasySpeak workarounds).
3. New exploit-based tweaks (e.g., SparseRestore).

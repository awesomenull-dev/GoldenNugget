"""Resolve HotLoad-hidden features/tweaks for the current device.

Shared by the GUI (hiding sections, sidebar gating) and the preset loader
(never re-enable hidden features on load). Replicates the old GUI-internal
helpers: reads the current device from ``DataSingleton`` and evaluates the
local HotLoad rules with whatever settings object the running app exposes.
